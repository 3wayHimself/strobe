# The Strobe Programming Langauge
Strobe is a dynamic programming langauge that gets compiled into a DIF executable.

If you find some bugs report them at [Issues](//github.com/mihail-mojsoski/Strobe/issues), so we can fix them.

```php
#include <bioslib.str>

namespace Name
{
	function Main()
	{
		System.Write("Hello, World!\n");
		System.Exit(0);
	}
}
```

The syntax is influenced by the following programming languages:

 - C - for the pre-processor instructions and comments;
 - X# - for the namespaces, functions and idea;
 - C# - for the namespaces and library names;
 - PHP - for the variables and functions;
