# The Strobe Compiler
The Strobe Compiler compiles Strobe code into DIF executeable that will be able to be executed in our VM.

If you find some report them at [Issues](//github.com/mihail-mojsoski/Strobe/issues), so we can fix them.

If you want to see how will the Strobe syntax look like, here it is:

```
#include <bioslib.str>

namespace Name {
	function Main() {
		System.Write("Hello World\n");
		System.Exit(0);
	}
}
```

The syntax is influenced by the following programming languages:

 - C - for the pre-processor instructions and comments;
 - X# - for the namespaces, functions and idea;
 - C# - for the namespaces and library names;
 - PHP - for the variables and functions;
